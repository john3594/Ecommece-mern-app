# The MERN-Stack E-commerce Web Application with Redux

The MERN stack e-commerce web application with Redux is a full-stack web application that uses MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js, and Redux to create an online shopping platform. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents. Express is a web framework for Node.js that handles routing, middleware, and API endpoints. React is a library for building user interfaces using components and JSX. Node.js is a runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside the browser. Redux is a state management tool that helps to manage the application state in a predictable way.
